# kosoglazyy-voron
KgV2

This is a mod for the Voron 2.4 that makes it use a CroXY motion system similar to that of the Annex Printers (though this isn't an annex printer nor is it a direct copy of their motion system stuffs)
 
(most of your plastic parts are useless for this mod, may as well consider this a different printer entirely that shares some of the v2.4 bom)

This may work on trident? maybe? idk lol
